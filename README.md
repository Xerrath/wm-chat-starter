# WM Chat Starter: Direct Messages and Group Chats

West-MEC Coding Year 2. A full stack chat app: **Node + Express** on the server, **MongoDB Atlas** for the data. The page and every `fetch` are already done. **You build the database and every route that talks to it.**

By the end of the week you can:

- **Sign up and sign in** with a username (no two people can have the same one).
- **Direct message** one person, Messenger style.
- **Start a group**, then **add people**, **rename** it, or **leave** it, Discord style.
- Open the app in **two or three tabs**, signed in as different people, and watch the messages show up in each other's tabs.

Everything lives in one database, `chatDB`, with three collections: `users`, `chats`, and `messages`.

## Setup

1. Open the terminal: **PowerShell**, **Git Bash**, or **Command Prompt** (any one works).
2. Move into your code folder on the Desktop (use your folder's real name):

   ```
   cd Desktop
   cd code
   ```

   Desktop not found? It may be inside OneDrive: `cd OneDrive`, then `cd Desktop`.

3. Clone the chat, then move into it:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Xerrath/wm-chat-starter.git
   cd wm-chat-starter
   ```

4. Install the packages (Express and the MongoDB driver):

   ```
   npm install
   ```

5. Make your `.env` file: copy `.env.example` and name the copy `.env`. **At Station A** you paste your **Atlas connection string** after `MONGODB_URI=` (no spaces, no quotes, your database user's password in place of `<db_password>`). Get the string in Atlas: your cluster > **Connect** > **Drivers and Client Libraries** > Node.js. Before Station A, leave it empty.

   Your string goes in **`.env` only**. `.env.example` is pushed to GitHub, so leave it as `MONGODB_URI=` with nothing after it.
6. Start the chat:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

7. Open **http://localhost:3000** in Chrome. Before Station A the line says **the practice server (until you build connectDB in Station A)**: a practice chatDB on this computer, so you can build Station U first. Anything you haven't built yet says **not built yet** in gray.

   The practice server needs MongoDB on this computer once: `npm run check-mongodb`, and only if it says NO, `npm run get-mongodb` (a big download).

Stop the server with **Ctrl+C**. After you change a server file (`mongo.js`, `server.js`), stop it and `npm start` again. After you change `public/api.js`, just refresh the page.

## The files

| File | What it is | Do you change it? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mongo.js` | Connects to MongoDB and sets up `chatDB` the first time. | **Yes (Station A)** |
| `server.js` | The Express server and every `/api` route. | **Yes (Station U, Day 3, Day 4, Extension)** |
| `public/api.js` | Every `fetch` the page makes to the server. | No (read it: it calls your routes) |
| `public/chat.js` | Draws the page and decides WHEN to ask the server (every 2 seconds). | No (read it!) |
| `public/index.html`, `global.css`, `images/` | The chat page. | No |
| `setup/` | Status and reset routes, the practice server (until Station A), the MongoDB download. | No |
| `.env` | Your connection string. **Never on GitHub.** | Yes (Day 1) |

## Test it with more than one person

You are the only one on your database, so **you play every person**. Each browser **tab** remembers its own sign-in:

1. Tab 1: sign up as yourself.
2. Tab 2 (Ctrl+T, same address): sign up as a second person.
3. Message each other. The other tab gets it within 2 seconds.

## See your data

- **Atlas:** Data Explorer (Browse Collections) > `chatDB` > `users`, `chats`, `messages`.
- **Any GET route** in the browser, like **http://localhost:3000/api/users**.
- **Start over:** the **Reset chat** button empties `chatDB` and puts WM Bot and the West-MEC Lounge back. Every account is gone, so sign up again.

## Stuck?

- **EADDRINUSE**: the chat is already running in another terminal. Ctrl+C there.
- **I changed server.js but nothing changed**: stop the server (Ctrl+C) and `npm start` again.
- **`bad auth : authentication failed`**: the password in your string is wrong, or `<db_password>` is still in it. It's the **database user** password, not your Atlas login. Reset it in Atlas: Security > Database Access > Edit > Edit Password.
- **`Invalid scheme`**: quotes or spaces around the string in `.env`. It must start right after `MONGODB_URI=`.
- **`querySrv ECONNREFUSED`**: this network can't look up a `mongodb+srv://` address. Use the long `mongodb://...shard-00-00...` version of your string instead, and tell your teacher.
- **`Server selection timed out`**: your IP isn't on the Atlas list. Security > Network Access > Add Current IP Address, wait a minute, restart.
- **It says "the practice server"**: your `.env` isn't being read. Check it's named exactly `.env` (not `.env.txt`) and the string is in `.env`, not `.env.example`.
- **Reset chat** deletes every account. Only press it when you mean to.
- **No Atlas today?** Leave `MONGODB_URI=` empty to use a practice MongoDB on this computer (`npm run check-mongodb`, and only if it says NO, `npm run get-mongodb`). Ask your teacher first: it's a big download.

Needs Node.js 20.19 or newer (`node -v` to check).
